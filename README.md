# TCP-broadcast-tree
A broadcaster process node. Which can be either a root node or ordinary node. An ordinary node has a parent, which is connected to the right at the startup, while the root node does not have any parent. Both root and ordinary node keep accepting concurrent connections from other nodes as children, with every node could be having exactly one parent node, hence independently executed instance of the process shapes a tree. The root node has a state that keeps it as a single string. Each node on the tree has a local view of the root node's state. The root user is able to update the value of the state arbitrarily. The update state value of the root is kept broadcasting in a top-down manner towards the leaves of the broadcast tree. All the connections among nodes are persistent TCPs. To keep them alive, between the events of root nodes updates invertals (which are arbitrarily irregularly governed by the root user), heartbeat messages were employed between each node and its parent.
